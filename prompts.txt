1. 

enrich the test data by adding in full the following: 

1. transaction_id instead of TransactionID
2. goods_description instead of Description
3. sythetic sender and receiver companiues with synthetic addressses, facility_canon_ids, company_canon_ids, and transaction_date's in 2023 as in mm/dd/yyyy.
4. then use node2vec to treat each sender or receiver company as a node and each transaction as an edge
